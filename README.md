🚀 Digital TA – Automated Digital Lab Grading System

A full-stack platform that automates programming lab evaluation with real-time code execution, instant feedback, analytics, and leaderboards.

📌 Problem Statement

Manual grading of programming labs in large university classes is time-consuming, inconsistent, and delays student feedback. Instructors spend more time validating syntax and edge cases than teaching core concepts, while students wait days for results.

Digital TA solves this by acting as an objective, real-time code judge, providing instant evaluation and performance insights for both students and instructors.
